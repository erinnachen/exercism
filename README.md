# Exercisms
This is my repository for solutions to the exercises found at [exercism.io](http://exercism.io). If you have yet to try exercisms, I had my doubts about it, then I tried to learn some new languages and had no idea what to do when starting, and I think it's been really helpful.

The languages that I have been working through in my "free" time are:
* Ruby
* Elixir
* JavaScript
* Python

Feel free to comment on my code on the exercism platform, or reach out and ask for help! See you around.
